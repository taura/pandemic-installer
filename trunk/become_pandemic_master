# become_pandemic_master
#  makes the machine a pandemic master
#
# Usage:
#  1. boot pandemic master with Ubuntu Live CD 
#     (or a customized Live CD, made by 
#      make_customize_live.mk)
#  2. open shell and run this script by:
#
#     ./become_pandemic_master
#
# What happens?
#  the above command turns this machine into 
#  a pandemic master.  see README for the basics,
#  but here is what basically happens.  it is based on
#  the approach described in 
#   http://d.hatena.ne.jp/adsaria/20090206/1233905956
#  the above page describes how to pxe-boot 
#  clients, as if the they booted from Live CD.
# 
#  1. assign a static IP address to the network 
#   interface through which talk to its clients. 
#   the interface and static IP address can be 
#   specified below by setting 'pandemic_netif'
#
#  2. install DHCP server (isc-dhcp-server) and
#    generate its config file /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
#   so that it serves any client connected to 
#   the same network. it specifies next-server to
#   this machine, so that PXE-booted clients first
#   obtains IP address from this machine and then
#   try to get kernel from the TFTP server running
#   on this machine.
#
#  3. install TFTP server (tftpd-hpa) and syslinux,
#    and generate TFTP server's config file
#  - generate 
#
#   /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default
#
#   so that the tftp server sends a kernel and 
#   initrd image to any client that successfully 
#   contacted to the DHCP server.
#
#  4. install NFS server (nfs-kernel-server) and
#    export an nfsroot, which is used as the root
#    file system of any client who contacted to 
#    the TFTP server
#

# variables you may want to customize
# ---------------------------------
# (0) media directory. the directory on which the Live CD
# is mounted. it is /cdrom when we boot up from CD.
# it should be something else I have not yet tested.
# you should set it so that you can find ${media}/casper 
# directory
media=/cdrom

# (1) network interface through which this machine (master) 
# is connected to clients. this script OVERWRITES its
# address and subnet.
pandemic_netif=eth0

# (2) the first three octets of the subnet in which master
# and clients speak; 
# TODO: currently, we assume the network is a /24 network
pandemic_subnet=10.0.3

# (3) the master's IP address
# if you ever want to customize this, make sure this does not
# overlap with the pandemic_client_range
pandemic_net_ipaddr=${pandemic_subnet}.15
pandemic_net_bcast=${pandemic_subnet}.255
pandemic_net_mask=255.255.255.0

# (4) IP address range for the clients
# this string is written into dhcpd.conf
pandemic_client_range="${pandemic_subnet}.100 ${pandemic_subnet}.199"

# (5) distribution name; it just names the nfsroot directory.
# otherwise it does not matter
distro=ubuntu-12.10-amd64

# (6) name of the nfsroot directory. 
# in my experience, it cannot not /var directory. NFS
# server complains saying it cannot be exported.
# stick with a directory under /tmp
#nfsroot=/tmp/`whoami`/${distro}
nfsroot=/rofs/patient_root
